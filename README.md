A Flappy Bird knockoff made in Python using Pygame.

## How to play

Use the space bar or the up arrow to navigate floppy bird through an infinite level of randomly generated pipes.

If you touch a pipe, you lose! And you will be sent back to the menu.

Floppy bird keeps track of your high score, so you will remember to play better next time!
